# Weather Forecast Application
The application is fully responsive. When a user clicks on the cities dropdown, a list of 5 city names will appear. Clicking on any city name will display its weather conditions.

To start the application, use the command npm run dev.

I have utilized the Axios package to fetch weather data from an API, and the application displays the corresponding weather forecast information.# Weather-application
